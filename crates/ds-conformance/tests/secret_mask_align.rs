//! A secret typed into the polkit prompt draws its dots from the field's leading edge,
//! where Blitz puts the caret. The prompt's card centres its text, and the mask (a span across
//! the field) used to inherit that, so the dots began mid-field with the caret before them while
//! Blitz laid the hidden text and its caret out from the start. Read from the painted pixels:
//! every ink pixel in the field (the dots and the caret) lies in its leading third.
//!
//! Blitz measures the hidden text in its editor's own face, untracked, so its caret fell
//! short of the Inter dots tracked .1em (two dots short at eleven). The field draws its own caret
//! among the dots, centred in the gap: after N characters the painted caret sits half a gap after
//! the N-th dot, after Left x3 clear of both the eighth and the ninth dot, and an unfocused field
//! paints no caret.
