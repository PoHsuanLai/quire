//! The widget contract's timeline on a real Blitz document and the virtual clock
//! (design/23-WIDGETS.md section 9.2): a card shows each entry from its date on, its placeholder
//! before the first, asks its provider for a new timeline once when the policy comes due (never
//! sooner than the floor), follows a new timeline the moment it is handed one, and between
//! dates asks for no frame at all (the idle-frame rule). Every test runs on `Clock::Virtual`, so
//! the dates are exact whatever the machine's load.
