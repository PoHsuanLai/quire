//! Swipe to dismiss on a real Blitz document (sill Q122): a drag released under the threshold
//! springs the card back and dismisses nothing; one released past it flies the card out and
//! reports `on_dismiss` at `settle(BannerOut)`, not before; a horizontal scroll is summed into
//! the same offset and decided once the deltas stop; the click that ends a drag never opens the
//! card; and under Reduced the flight settles at Reduced's length.
