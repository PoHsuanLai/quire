//! SegmentedControl's thumb and labels under real clicks (sill's control center, 2026-09-28), on
//! `Clock::Virtual` so every frame falls at an exact instant, at scale 1 and 2, light and dark,
//! every accent, in the three places the desktop draws one: the control center's compact
//! AppearancePicker, the full picker, and the small power-profile control (unequal words).
//!
//! 1. At rest the thumb, where it is painted (its slide applied), is exactly the selected
//!    segment's laid-out box; while it slides it is a segment wide and inside the track. The
//!    compact picker once made its segments a flex row sized by their words, so the thumb (a
//!    segment's equal share) missed the selected one; at scale 2 the thumb's own arithmetic also
//!    drifted from the rounded cells.
//! 2. On every frame, settled or mid-slide, after slow and rapid clicks, a label clear of the
//!    thumb reads at 4.5:1 against the track and a label wholly under it at 4.5:1 against the
//!    thumb (a label the thumb is crossing is neither). The labels' ink once ran a colour
//!    transition on its own clock: the picked label went to the thumb's light ink on the light
//!    track before the thumb arrived, and after a theme pick every label faded from the old
//!    scheme's ink (1.1:1 to 2.3:1 on the track).
//!
//! Also painted: at scale 2 the pixels just inside the selected segment's edges are the thumb's.
