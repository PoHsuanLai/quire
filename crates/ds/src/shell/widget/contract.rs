//! The widget contract (design/23-WIDGETS.md section 9): what a widget is, as one trait. A
//! widget is data in, content out: it names its kind and the sizes it draws, gives a placeholder
//! entry for a size, and draws an entry at a size. It never draws its card: the corner, the
//! inset, the material, the Space's tint and the title row are quire's ([`crate::WidgetCard`]),
//! so every widget, ours and other apps', sits on the same card.
