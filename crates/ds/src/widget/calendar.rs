//! The month widget on the widget contract (design/23-WIDGETS.md sections 5, 5.2 and 9.6), laid
//! out as the reference's calendar widgets are rather than one grid stretched over the card:
//! Small, the compact month filling the card at its own pitch; Medium, a today column (the
//! weekday in the accent, the date large, the next event or the quiet line) beside the compact
//! month at the small card's metrics; Large, the regular month at its own pitch, centred, over
//! the day's events. The header's step buttons are the widget's one control: they send
//! [`MonthIntent::Step`], and the provider answers with the next month's timeline.
