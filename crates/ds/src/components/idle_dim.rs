//! `IdleDim`: the pre-screen-off dim overlay (design/22-SETTINGS.md section 3.24; sill FINDINGS
//! "sill idle (Q420 B)"). A full-screen scrim, black at `level` (`--scrim-idle`), never real
//! brightness, that ignores every pointer and key event: sill's idle service owns waking the
//! display, this draws the dim and nothing else. It fades in over `--t-idle-dim --e-out`
//! towards `level` and snaps to nothing the instant `phase` goes back to
//! [`IdleDimPhase::Awake`] — there is no exit animation to wait for
//! (`ds::detail::use_idle_dim`; CONSUMING.md "Idle dim").
//!
//! **Where it goes.** Its own root, above every other surface: `Ds { extent:
//! RootExtent::Viewport, chrome: Some(RootChrome::Transparent), .. }`, with `IdleDim` as the
//! root's only child (CONSUMING.md "A document's frame must have a height": `Viewport` is what
//! gives an all-positioned root one).
