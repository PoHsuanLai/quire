//! A notification's body, clamped to two lines at rest and six under the pointer (sill Q120;
//! design/13 section 13.3.6). Blitz has no `-webkit-line-clamp` (the risk table; CONSUMING
//! section 8), so the clamp is a `max-height` of whole lines (`calc(2 * 1.35em)`, `6 *` on
//! hover) with a `--t-move --e-out` transition, and the fade that marks cut text is decided in
//! Rust: the body measures its text and one line once laid out, counts its lines, and writes
//! `data-clip` so the fade is drawn only where text is actually cut. A body of two lines never
//! fades; one of four fades at rest and not on hover; one of nine fades on both.
