//! A month laid out the way the shell lays it out (sill's `month_grid`), so the tests and the
//! gallery have real months to draw: proleptic Gregorian civil dates by day count, the first
//! weekday, the neighbours' padding days, today, the busy days, and each row's ISO week (the
//! week of its Thursday). quire itself never computes a month; this stands in for the caller.
