//! MonthGrid: a month of days in seven columns, the calendar widget's month (design/04-COMPONENTS.md
//! section 39; design/20-SURFACES.md section 1.12). The shell computes the month;
//! this draws it: a header with the month's title and, when the caller steps months, the
//! previous and next `Button { Tool }`; the weekday heads; then the weeks, optionally led by
//! their ISO week numbers, the neighbours' days quieter, today on the accent disc and a busy
//! day's dot. A change of month slides the weeks in once (`month_grid_weeks`).
//!
//! Two densities: the regular grid, and a compact one that fits a small desktop
//! widget's 140 x 140 content box, which the regular grid (224 x 254 for six weeks) overflows.
//! `MonthDensity::Auto` picks between them by the enclosing `WidgetFrame`.

/// A month. `data` is the month as the shell laid it out; `weeks` whether each row leads with
/// its ISO week. With `onstep` the header ends in the previous and next buttons, which call it
/// with their `MonthStep`; without it the header is the title alone. With `onpick` every day is a
/// `button` that calls it with the day's key; without it the days are plain text.
///
/// Changing `data.month` slides the new month's weeks in once: from the right for a later
/// month (`slide-r`), from the left for an earlier one (`slide-l`); the first month drawn and
/// a render that keeps the month play nothing.
///
/// `density` (`Auto`) is written as `data-density`: `Auto` draws compact inside a
/// `WidgetFrame { size: Small }` and regular inside a Medium or Large one or outside any frame;
/// `Regular` and `Compact` force it. The compact grid fills its box (in a small frame, the
/// 140 x 140 content box): a 14 px header of `--fs-micro` title and 14 px glyph buttons, 12 px
/// heads, then the weeks sharing the rest evenly, seven columns across (20 each) and the rows
/// down (19.67 for six weeks, 23.6 for five, the weeks running 4 past the box's foot as an
/// optical inset), today on a 20 px disc (twice `--fs-caption`) in the middle of its
/// row and a 3 px dot, measured on Blitz (the `month_grid_density` harness test). It never draws
/// week numbers, whatever `weeks` says: a week column would not fit.
