//! The shell's metric tokens: the control center's sizes on the ladder, the dock, OSD,
//! notifications and the widget grid. Each family is a `Token` listed in `ds_shell::KIT`, so the
//! stylesheet and the linter read them from there. The type scale, the menus' and bar's sizes and
//! the widgets' paints are `ds-style`'s, because generic components read them.
