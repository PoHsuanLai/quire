//! One row of a `BannerStack`: the card in a `div.ds-banner` that plays the row's
//! exit and heal (`banner-out`, `heal`), with the entrance (`banner-in`) on the `div.ds-banner-card`
//! inside it, and the height it measures, which is how far the rows after it heal when it
//! leaves. The gap to the next banner is the row's own padding, so the measured height is the
//! whole pitch.
//!
//! The entrance is the inner element's, played once as it mounts, rather than a rule on the
//! row's `data-presence=entering`: Blitz keeps the last animated value when an animation is
//! taken off an element, so a presence that turned `present` before a frame had been resolved
//! past the entrance's end (a loaded machine, a snapshot's clock) froze the row mid-slide.
//!
//! The row hands its card a `Carried` holding its `Flight`: a card swiped away marks it, and the
//! row writes `data-flight=swipe`, which points its exit right whatever the stack's entry edge.
