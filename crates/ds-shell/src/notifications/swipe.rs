//! A notification card's swipe to dismiss: whether the card takes one, and how its flight ends,
//! over the swipe glue a toast shares (`ds::SwipeGlue`).
//!
//! When a swipe ends past a threshold the card flies out to the right from where it is. Alone,
//! it plays `panel-out` itself and reports `on_dismiss` at `settle(PanelOut)`, so a caller that
//! unmounts it there never cuts the flight short. Inside a `BannerStack` the stack's row carries
//! the flight: the card holds its offset, reports at once, and the caller's removal of it makes
//! the row slide out from that offset (the two transforms compose), then the rows below heal.
