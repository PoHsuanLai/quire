//! `use_widget`: the entry a widget shows now, from its provider's timeline (design/23-WIDGETS.md
//! section 9.2). The hook reads the design system's clock, so on a test's virtual clock the
//! entries change exactly when the test advances past their dates. It wakes only for what the
//! timeline holds (the next entry's date, the refresh), as the [`Follower`] machine's wake, and
//! sleeps on nothing else: a widget whose provider pushes one entry at a time costs no frame
//! between pushes (the idle-frame rule).
